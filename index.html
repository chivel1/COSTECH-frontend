                    U.S.

                        Volvo told Car and Driver today that the electric EX30 crossover will be delayed until 2025.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        A spokesperson cited "changes in the global automotive landscape" and said that EX30s bound for
                        the U.S.
                        will eventually come from Volvo's Belgium plant.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        The EX30 is currently being built in China, and the U.S. recently raised its tariff on
                        Chinese-imported
                        EVs to 100 percent.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The Volvo EX30 looked promising when it was first revealed last summer. The tiny electric SUV
                    combined a
                    smart design with a capable powertrain and a solid driving range, all for a low starting price of
                    $36,245.
                    While sales of the EX30 were supposed to kick off this summer, customers in the United States will
                    now have
                    to wait awhile longer, with Volvo today confirming to Car and Driver that the EX30 will be delayed
                    until
                    next year.

                    Volvo cited "changes in the global automotive landscape" and said the delay will last while the
                    automaker gears up production at its factory in Ghent, Belgium. The EX30 is already being built in China, and
                    initial U.S.-bound units were expected to come from the Zhangjiakou factory. However, it seems that the
                    recent introduction of a 100 percent tariff on Chinese-made vehicles has altered those plans.

                        Volkswagen revealed the updated version of the Golf R, which benefits from numerous upgrades.

                    <li>
                        The turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four now makes 328 horsepower, or 13 horsepower more than
                        before.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        Sadly, the manual transmission is no longer available, leaving only a dual-clutch automatic.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The 2025 Golf R's new front-end design is highlighted by a light-up VW badge, new headlights, and reworked bumpers. The taillights are also redone, and new 19-inch wheels—which VW calls "Warmenau" after the name of the town where its R division is headquartered—are said to reduce unsprung weight. The Black Edition has darkened badges, black brake calipers, black exhaust tips, and black wheels, and VW confirmed that this package is coming to the U.S.
                    Because of the 13 extra horsepower from the turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four engine, VW says the new model will be slightly quicker than before; the automatic-transmission Golf R previously got to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds in our testing, so we can expect to shave a couple tenths off that time. All-wheel drive remains standard, but the only transmission choice is now the seven-speed dual-clutch automatic.

Yet few know the fascinating story behind the birth of this ‘crest’, as Porsche itself calls the logo. While internally at the company it is in fact only the PORSCHE lettering that officially represents the ‘logo’, of course fans the world-over view the entirety of this crest as the Porsche logo, and thus why we’ll refer to it as the Porsche ‘logo’ throughout this article. The start of this logo’s story? It traces all the way back to a 1951 design competition.</p>
